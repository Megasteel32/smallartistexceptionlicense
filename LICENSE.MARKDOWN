In addition to the terms of the CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 license, the following Additional Terms and Exceptions apply:

You may use my files for commercial purposes provided the following:

- You still refer to this respository as the source
- You sell your work for a reasonable price. Use common sense here, a US letter sheet of nice cardstock with something plotted on it shouldn't cost more than $10, maybe $20 (at the time of writing 2024, USD). Basically, if you're charging 100x bill of materials, you're doing too much.
- You do NOT create NFT's or somehow utilize my work for the training of AI or the generation of AI images. You can use AI for code generation from my work.
- You're not a mega corporation. Or really any corporation with a value over $1 million USD.
- You somehow use my work for harm? Not sure how but don't do that.

This exception is meant for small artists or studios, and should be a supplementation to one's own work, not the only thing they sell.

These Additional Terms and Exceptions are to be interpreted in conjunction with the CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 license. Where there is any conflict between these Additional Terms and Exceptions and the CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 license, these Additional Terms and Exceptions shall take precedence.
